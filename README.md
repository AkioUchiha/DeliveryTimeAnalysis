# Food Delivery Time Analysis
This project aims to gain insights into the factors influencing food delivery times and to explore the direct correlations between delivery time and various variables. By analyzing the data, we hope to understand how specific factors contribute to the efficiency and speed of food delivery.

Project Overview:
Understanding the dynamics behind food delivery times is crucial for optimizing delivery services and enhancing customer satisfaction. In this project, we consider several key factors that may influence delivery times, including:

Age of the Delivery Person: Exploring whether the age of the delivery person has an impact on the time it takes to complete a delivery.

Distance Between the Restaurant and Delivery Location: Analyzing how the distance traveled by the delivery person affects the delivery time.

Driver Ratings: Investigating the correlation between the ratings of the driver and the time taken for delivery, considering whether higher-rated drivers complete deliveries faster.

Objectives:
Identify Key Factors: Determine which factors most significantly affect delivery times.
Correlational Analysis: Explore the relationship between delivery times and the identified factors.
Data-Driven Insights: Provide actionable insights for improving delivery efficiency.
Data and Methodology
The project utilizes a dataset containing information on various delivery events. The data includes details such as the age of the delivery person, the distance between the restaurant and the delivery location, and the driver's ratings. We will employ statistical methods and data visualization techniques to uncover patterns and correlations within the data.

Conclusion:
By the end of this analysis, we aim to deliver meaningful insights that can help food delivery services optimize their operations, leading to faster deliveries and better customer experiences.
